# ðŸ‘‹ Hello ! Iâ€™m @Doriankmf

I'm currently a PhD student working on the theme of robotic perception. I work at the ModÃ©lisation, Information & SystÃ¨mes laboratory (MIS laboratory) in Amiens, France, more precisely in the "Perception Robotique" team (Robotics Perception).
The aim of this thesis is to find a method for using non-static parts of a scene to improve the accuracy and completeness of 3D point clouds in multi-sensor and multi-robot mapping of large buildings and infrastructures.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Robotics Perception ! More precisely: **3D reconstruction, 3D point clouds registration, Visual SLAM, Visual Odometry, SLAM**

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Registration of large 3D point clouds in a multi-robot and multi-sensor context
